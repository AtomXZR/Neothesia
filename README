-------

To compile, you need a basic c++ toolchain, and satisfy all dependences
which are on BUILD-DEPENDS file. Then, just:

    $ autoreconf -ivf

Here you must choose:

 a) For developers

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build     # Isolate compilation to speed future compilations
    $ ../configure

 b) For general public

    $ ../configure --prefix=/usr

Then:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install
